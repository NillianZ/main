This application is a straightforward program centered around a sign-in function that manages user authentication. While some planned features and options are still in progress, the app already includes several mini-games designed to pass the time and offer lighthearted humor.

One of the featured games is a Tap Game, which challenges players to click as quickly as possible within a 10-second time frame. This fast-paced game tracks the player’s score and maintains a high score to encourage repeated play and improvement.

In addition to the Tap Game, the app includes a small quiz designed primarily for humorous entertainment rather than serious testing.

Furthermore, the app offers a button that directs users to an external website, leading to another clicking game for comparison and additional amusement.

Overall, the app blends simple user authentication with casual gameplay and light humor.

Changelog:

Routing and Navigation Updates

Added a new screen tapGame to the router stack in app/_layout.tsx to enable navigation to the newly created mini-game screen.

Fixed navigation routes in app/mainPage.tsx to correctly push to the intended screens, such as replacing router.push('/') with router.push('/mainPage') for accurate routing.

New Features

Introduced a “Tap Game” mini-game (app/tapGame.tsx) featuring a countdown timer, tap scoring, high score persistence using AsyncStorage, animated feedback on taps, and a styled gradient interface. This enhances user engagement by adding interactive gameplay within the app.

Added a button in the main page (app/mainPage.tsx) that opens an external URL (https://clickclickclick.click) using React Native’s Linking.openURL() API, allowing users to visit a fun external site.

Code Quality and Cleanup

Cleaned up import statements in app/sign-in.tsx for better readability by removing unnecessary comments.

Simplified comments in components/HeaderComponent.tsx without affecting functionality.

Refactored the sign-out logic in components/SignOutButton.tsx to fix a TypeScript typing error by removing the direct usage of signOut as an event handler, improving type safety and error handling.

Dependency Management

Updated and locked specific package versions in package.json, including fixing versions of @react-native-async-storage/async-storage, upgrading TypeScript typings for React to align with the latest React version, and bumping the expo-linear-gradient version.

Regenerated package-lock.json reflecting the updated and pruned dependencies to ensure consistent and stable package installations.
